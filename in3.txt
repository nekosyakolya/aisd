all that I have is all that you've given me. 
did you never worry that I'd come to depend on you.
 i gave you all the love I had in me.now I find you've lied and 
I can't believe it's true....

wrapped in her arms I see you across the street. And I can't help but wonder 
if she knows what's going on.    you talk of love but you don't know 
how it feels. 
When you realize that you're not the only one
